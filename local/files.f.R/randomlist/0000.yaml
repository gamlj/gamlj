  A suite for estimation of linear models, such as the general linear model,
  linear mixed model, generalized linear models and generalized mixed models.
  For ech family, models can be estimated with categorical and/or continuous
  variables, with options to facilitate estimation of  interactions, simple
  slopes, simple effects, post-hoc tests, contrast analysis and visualization of
  the results.

      General Linear Model. Estimates models using `lm()` function and provides
      options to facilitate estimation of 

      interactions, simple slopes, simple effects, post-hoc tests, contrast
      analysis, effect size indexes and visualization of the results.
