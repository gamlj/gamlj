Estimates a General Linear Model, Mixed Linear Models, Generalized Linear Models and Generalized Mixed Models with categorical and/or continuous variables, with options to facilitate estimation of interactions, simple slopes, simple effects, post-hoc etc.


* Continuous and categorical independent and dependent variables
* F-test and parameter estimates
* Confidence intervals
* Moderation made easy
* Simple slopes analysis
* Simple effects
* Polynomial effects
* Post-hoc analysis
* Contrasts analysis
* Plots up to three-way interactions
* Automatic selection of best estimation methods and degrees of freedom selection
* Type III estimation

# Install in jamovi

Please install [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/download.html) and run it. Select the jamovi modules library and install GAMLj from there

# Version 3

GAMLj has undergone a major upgrading with version 3.*. The upgrading made version 3 not compatible with previous versions of the module, meaning
that analyses that are done with previous versions cannot be opened with version 3. If you need to open and work with analyses done with GAMLj version < 3.0.0, you can install GAMLj legacy from the jamovi library. It will not interfere with GAMLj3.

## From GitHub

In your R script (or Rstudio) simply issue 

```

devtools::install_github("gamlj/gamlj")

```

## From source


You will first need to download [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/download.html). 

You can clone this repository and compile the module within R with 

```
library(jmvtools)

jmvtools::install()

```

# Previous Version (GAMLj 2.6.6 or below)

If you want to install the latest previous version of the module (Version 2.6.6) in R, run this:

```
devtools::install_github("gamlj/gamlj",ref="Version.2.6.6")

```
