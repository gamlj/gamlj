# effectsize 0.4.4

`effectsize` now supports `R >= 3.4`.

## New features

- `standardize_parameters()` now supports bootstrapped estimates (from `parameters::bootstrap_model()` and `parameters::bootstrap_parameters()`).
- `unstandardize()` which will reverse the effects of `standardize()`.
- `interpret_kendalls_w()` to interpret Kendall's coefficient of concordance.
- `eta_squared()` family of functions can now also return effect sizes for the intercept by setting `include_intercept = TRUE` ( #156 ).

## Bug fixes

- `standardize()` can now deal with dates ( #300 ).

# effectsize 0.4.3

## Breaking Changes

- `oddsratio()` and `riskratio()` - order of groups has been changed (the
  *first* groups is now the **treatment group**, and the *second* group is the
  **control group**), so that effect sizes are given as *treatment over control*
  (treatment / control) (previously was reversed). This is done to be consistent
  with other functions in R and in `effectsize`.

## New features

- `cohens_h()` effect size for comparing two independent proportions.

- `rank_biserial()`, `cliffs_delta()`, `rank_epsilon_squared()` and
  `kendalls_w()` functions for effect sizes for rank-based tests.

- `adjust()` gains `keep_intercept` argument to keep the intercept.

- `eta_squared()` family of functions supports `Anova.mlm` objects (from the
  `car` package).

- `effectsize()`:

  - supports Cohen's *g* for McNemar's test.

  - Extracts OR from Fisher's Exact Test in the 2x2 case.

  for ANOVA ( #240 ).

- `cohens_d()` family of functions gain `mu` argument.

## Bug fixes

- `adjust()` properly works when `multilevel = TRUE`.

- `cohens_d()` family / `sd_pooled()` now properly fails when given a missing
  column name.

## Changes

- `effectsize()` for `htest` objects now tries first to extract the data used
  for testing, and computed the effect size directly on that data.

- `cohens_d()` family / `sd_pooled()` now respect any transformations (e.g.
  `I(log(x) - 3) ~ factor(y)`) in a passed formula.

- `eta_squared()` family of functions gains a `verbose` argument.

- `verbose` argument more strictly respected.

- `glass_delta()` returns CIs based on the bootstrap.

# effectsize 0.4.1

## Breaking Changes

- `cohens_d()` and `glass_delta()`: The `correction` argument has been
  deprecated, in favor of it being correctly implemented in `hedges_g()` ( #222
  ).

- `eta_squared_posterior()` no longer uses `car::Anova()` by default.

## New features

  one-way between subjects design (#180).

## Bug fixes

- `hedges_g()` correctly implements the available bias correction methods ( #222
  ).

- Fixed width of CI for Cohen's *d* and Hedges' *g* when using *non*-pooled SD.

# effectsize 0.4.0

## Breaking Changes

- `standardize_parameters()` for multi-component models (such as zero-inflated)
  now returns the unstandardized parameters in some cases where standardization
  is not possible (previously returned `NA`s).

- Column name changes:

  - `eta_squared()` / `F_to_eta2` families of function now has the `Eta2`
    format, where previously was `Eta_Sq`.

  - `cramers_v` is now `Cramers_v`

  #82 ).

- Added `hardlyworking` (simulated) dataset, for use in examples.

- `interpret_*` ( #131 ):

  - `interpret_omega_squared()` added `"cohen1992"` rule.

  - `interpret_p()` added *Redefine statistical significance* rules.

- `oddsratio_to_riskratio()` for converting OR to RR.

## Changes

- CIs for Omega-/Epsilon-squared and Adjusted Phi/Cramer's V return 0s instead
  of negative values.

- `standardize()` for data frames gains the `remove_na` argument for dealing
  with `NA`s ( #147 ).

- `standardize()` and `standardize_info()` now (and by extension,
  `standardize_parameters()`) respect the weights in weighted models when
  standardizing ( #82 ).

- Internal changes to `standardize_parameters()` (reducing co-dependency with
  `parameters`) - argument `parameters` has been dropped.

  ).

  outcome.

- Setting `two_sd = TRUE` in `standardize()` and `standardize_parameters()`
  (correctly) on uses 2-SDs of the predictors (and not the response).

- `standardize_info()` / `standardize_parameters(method = "posthoc")` work for
  zero-inflated models ( #135 )

- `standardize_info(include_pseudo = TRUE)` / `standardize_parameters(method =
  "pseudo")` are less sensitive in detecting between-group variation of
  within-group variables.

- `interpret_oddsratio()` correctly treats extremely small odds the same as
  treats extremely large ones.

# effectsize 0.3.3

## New features

## Changes

  data in the model formula ( #113 ).
