\title{Generated data to test different types of linear models. The variables can be used as:
      
      `x` and `z` as two continuous independent variables; 
      
      `cat2` and `cat3`  as categorical independent variables, with two and three groups respectively;
      
      `ycont` is a continuous variable, suitable as dependent variable. 
      `ybin` is dichotomous dependent variable; `ypoi` a count variable (Poisson),
      `yord` and ordinal dependent variable with 5 levels, and `ycat` a categorical dependent variable with three groups.}
