  A suite for estimation of linear model, such as the general linear model,
  linear mixed model, generalized linear models. For ech family, models can be
  estimated for with categorical and/or continuous variables, with options to
  facilitate estimation of  interactions, simple slopes, simple effects,
  post-hoc tests, contrast analysis and visualization of the results.
