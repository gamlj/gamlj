Version: 2.9.0
Author: Marcello Gallucci
Maintainer: Marcello Gallucci <mcfanda@gmail.com>
Description: A suite for estimating linear models, such as the general linear model, linear mixed models,
             generalized linear models and generalized mixed models. For each family, models can be estimated
             with categorical and/or continuous variables, with options to facilitate estimation of 
             interactions, simple slopes, simple effects, post-hoc tests, contrast analysis, effect size indexes, and visualization of the results.
